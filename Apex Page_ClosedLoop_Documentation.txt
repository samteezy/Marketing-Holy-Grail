			<td>
				The Marketing Holy Grail is a natively written Salesforce.com app that produces closed loop reports for your organization.  This is the Campaign Influence for Salesforce you've been waiting for!  It allows you to quantify marketing’s influence over sales.  Data is collected using an Account-Based Attribution model, which means you no longer have to depend on contacts being directly associated to an opportunity.  Customize all major data points to guarantee the results match your business.  The application is specifically designed to work with both standard and custom fields.
				<br/><br/>
				If you decide to change the report settings midstream, simply update the program settings and click to refresh your data.  The report data is rebuilt from scratch each time you run the program.  This ensures data accuracy and guarantees that activities such as field updates and duplicate record merging do not affect your results.

				<td>Attribution only takes place during the influence timeframe that you choose.  All campaign activity is associated to opportunities when the Campaign Member Responded Date falls within X months prior to the Opportunity Created Date and ends on the Opportunity Close Date.  The Opportunity Close Date is not considered final until the Opportunity is closed.  i.e. Open Opportunities will attribute all related campaign influence that occurs after the Opportunity Created Date.  When an Opportunity is closed, the campaign influence that took place after the Close Date will no longer be included.  Always use the “Start Refresh” button to ensure you are viewing the most accurate data.</td>
